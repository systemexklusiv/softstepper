Looper Monitor Script for Ableton Live and the Softstep2


Take a look and Edit the file to your liking:
LooperMonitorSettings.py
Currently a looper-device with the name "ssl1" will be used as monitor source for pad number 0 on the softstep.

Where you can assing a looper device name with one of the 10 pads of the softstep
!Remember to turn off internal LED of the softstep. The ableton script will take care :)
